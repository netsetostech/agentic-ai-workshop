# DocuMind AI — deploy kit
#
# Tier A (offline, no GCP, free) — run anywhere, runs in CI:
#     make dryrun          extract check + full offline validation
#     make extract         (re)generate the deploy tree from the notebooks
#     make validate        run the Tier-A checks only
#
# Tier B (live, needs gcloud + terraform + a throwaway project — YOU run these on GCP):
#     make plan  PROJECT=documind-ai-live-0910     prepare verified inputs and save a checked plan
#     make up    PROJECT=...                        apply that reviewed plan, then build/deploy and seed
#     Initialize the intended Terraform backend first; plan/up never reconfigure it.
#     make tenant-policy TENANT= DATA_REGION=in|any   where a tenant's text may be held (13 September 2026): in = the kit's rows only; any = the managed stores too
#     make tenant-backend TENANT= RETRIEVAL_BACKEND=  which store answers one tenant (vector | firestore | rag_engine | vertex_search | default); make up pins acme and zeta
#     make media [MEDIA_ARGS=--video]              the corpus's figures (and the town hall video) under evals/corpus/
#     make ingest-corpus PROJECT=...                the corpus into the uploads bucket, one prefix per tenant
#     make smoke DOCUMIND_API_URL=https://...       end-to-end smoke test
#     make trainset / cache / judge / tune / candidate   Module 10: the dataset, the tenant cache, the second judge,
#                                                   the managed tuning job, a no-traffic revision for the A/B
#     make eval-live PROJECT=... [SOURCE=<doc>]     the golden set against the deployed API (scoped to one document's rows)
#     make reindex FILE= NAME= / sources / purge     the document lifecycle (deploy/INDEXING.md); smoke-reindex smokes it
#     make retire / restore SOURCE=                 withdraw a document (a tombstone the nightly walk honours), bring it back
#     make batch / queued / batch-job            the batch lane (13 September 2026): drain the queue now, list it, declare the job
#     make graph TENANT=acme                     build the tenant's knowledge graph (4.6) for RETRIEVAL_GRAPH=on|auto
#     make managed-status / rag-corpus TENANT=   the managed mirror (P9, 4.3 + 4.4): the stores against the ledger; a tenant's RAG Engine corpus
#     make candidate RETRIEVAL_BACKEND=rag_engine  4.3's corpus as the API's retrieval stage (P9.4), judged on a candidate; make ablate ABLATE_ARGS="--arms all" first
#     make rag-engine-enable                     once per project: RAG Engine in serverless mode + vectorsearch (4.3's one-time prep)
#     make down  PROJECT=...                        the services, then terraform destroy; names what only project deletion removes
#
# ONE SHAPE (15 September 2026; the lean | full switch is gone): seven Cloud Run services - the ingest worker, the API,
# the admin console, the UI, the chat service on its Cloud SQL checkpointer, the MCP server and the A2A peer (an eighth,
# the Google Chat bridge, on request) - Firestore with its vector indexes, Vector Search and its endpoint, Spanner
# Graph, the GKE lab cluster, the BigQuery mirror and Dataplex scan, the log sink, Cloud Deploy, the managed stores of
# 4.3 and 4.4, one Document AI processor, the buckets, the accounts, secrets, budget and alerts. See README.md.
#
# On Windows without `make`, run the python commands directly, e.g.
#     python deploy/validate.py
#     python commands/lane.py sources          (the lane's records: mk/*.mk targets as direct Python calls)
#
# Tier B targets require terraform + gcloud and a real PROJECT; they intentionally
# refuse to run without it. See README.md for the full live-day runbook.

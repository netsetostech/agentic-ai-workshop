"""Build golden.jsonl - 57 rows: 30 over the synthetic tenant documents, tenant-isolation
included, and 27 over the real documents that fetch_real.py puts under acme, zeta and globex
(thirteen of them: twelve Acts and Codes of Parliament and the ministry's compliance handbook).

Schema is lesson 4.7's, unchanged:
    {id, shape, question, tenant, must_contain, must_retrieve, answerable[, note]}
    shape in {lookup, join, refusal, isolation, version}

A `version` row (12 September 2026, the ledger) names its `source` document; its must_contain is
the CURRENT version's figure and its must_not_contain a figure only a RETIRED version under
evals/demo holds. It moves with the document, in the same commit: re-issue the handbook without
moving it and the offline gate is red before anything deploys.

4.7's recall_at_k matches `must_retrieve` entries as SUBSTRINGS of the retrieved ids, so
anchors here are document slugs and clause ids - both of which the runner can see. See
README.md for the one integration decision this leaves to 12.7.

Every assertion below is checked against corpus/ by the verifier at the bottom: a row that
asserts a figure the corpus does not contain fails the build rather than failing silently
in CI three weeks later. For the real documents "the corpus" is the pypdf mirror
(corpus/<tenant>/<slug>.md) that fetch_real.py extracts beside each PDF, so every figure a
real-data row asserts is the statute's own wording as the PDF carries it.

# The batch lane's consumer (12.5, 13 September 2026): the job that indexes the documents the push path handed
# off - anything over MAX_INLINE_PAGES, which cannot finish inside a push request's 600 seconds. Declared here on
# the ingest image the lane already runs (var.reconcile_image: make batch-job passes
# REGION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT/documind/ingest:SHA), beside the IAM grant that lets the worker start it and an
# hourly schedule that drains whatever the worker could not start. Like reconcile.tf, one apply: BATCH_JOB=true on
# make plan / make up once an ingest image exists (the job cannot be created before its image is pushed), and
# `make batch-job` is an apply with the switch on. The worker learns the job's name through BATCH_JOB in its own
# environment (commands/lesson-12.5.sh) and starts it the moment it queues a document.

# The managed stores (P9.1, 13 September 2026): what lessons 4.3 and 4.4 build, declared per tenant for the mirror
# (services/ingest/managed.py, MANAGED_MIRROR) and the rag_engine / vertex_search retrieval backends (P9.4, P9.5).
# One store per tenant - RAG Engine has no metadata filter and Vertex AI Search's needs a schema, so isolation is
# structural (the plan's D2). A Vertex AI Search data store is a Terraform resource and is declared here, in
# `global` (the only home a generic data store has), behind MANAGED_SEARCH=true. A RAG Engine corpus is not a
# Terraform resource: `make rag-corpus TENANT=` creates one idempotently by display name, in us-central1 (the
# only region serverless corpora have), after `make rag-engine-enable` has switched the project to serverless
# mode once (4.3's one-time prep). Neither store is inside India (us-central1, global), so a tenant's text reaches
# them only when its data_region policy says `any` (tenant_settings/{tenant}, make tenant-policy; managed.py asks
# per document and audits every copy) - the `tenants` variable lists the tenants whose policy is `any`.

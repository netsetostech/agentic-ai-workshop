# The ledger's nightly full reconciliation (12.5, 11 September 2026): the bucket's current generations against
# sources/. Objects gone from the bucket are retired, objects newer than their ledger row are re-ingested through
# the worker's own path, and the walk ends with one number - drift - that alerts.tf turns into a metric.
#
# 12 September 2026: the whole night is one apply. The JOB is declared here, on the ingest image the lane already
# runs (var.reconcile_image: make reconcile-job passes REGION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT/documind/ingest:SHA), beside
# the IAM grant and the schedule. Nothing operational is created by hand: RECONCILE_JOB=true on make plan / make up
# once an ingest image exists (the job cannot be created before its image is pushed), and `make reconcile-job`
# is an apply with the switch on - an image bump, not a creator.

# The LiteLLM gateway (11.3) and the self-hosting identities. Module 11, 10 September 2026.
#
# The gateway is a CPU-only Cloud Run service behind IAM: the API and the UI's account may invoke it (make deploy-gateway
# grants that with gcloud, because the services do not exist at plan time), and the caller's ID token is the door. Its
# spend logs and tag budgets live in the Cloud SQL instance below, which make deploy-gateway mounts as DATABASE_URL
# through the connector (15 September 2026: one shape, the database always declared). It calls Gemini on the global endpoint as itself (aiplatform.user), inspects
# prompts with Sensitive Data Protection when the audit sampler is on (dlp.user), and reaches the SLM and the vLLM engine
# through its token proxy with its own ID token - so those two services grant it run.invoker when they are deployed.

#
# roles/run.invoker is not granted in this file any more. It was - at PROJECT scope, to ui, chat,
# mcp, outsider and agent - and the comment on each of those lines already said the right answer:
# narrow it per service. The services are created by `gcloud run deploy` in commands/lesson-*.sh,
# not by Terraform, so the binding that tells the truth is the callee's own, in the script that
# deploys it, for exactly the callers that reach it:
#
#     gcloud run services add-iam-policy-binding <service> --member=serviceAccount:<caller> \
#       --role=roles/run.invoker
#
# (the shape lesson-8.4.sh and the Makefile's deploy-gateway already used). What project scope
# cost: every one of those identities could knock on every service, and documind-agent verifies
# nobody itself - IAM is its door, and it speaks to the lane as documind-agent-sa, on acme's
# roster - so the eval gate's outsider, admitted "everywhere", could read acme's documents through
# the peer. The gate check_authz.py parses the six lines below and the six scripts, and fails
# when they disagree.

# Each edge, from the code. The UI calls the API (frontend/chat.py, documents.py, studio.py:
# RAG_API_URL) and the chat service's brains (chat.py: CHAT_URL). chat-sa and mcp-sa reach the API
# through the ONE retrieve() (shared/documind_tools, RAG_API_URL) and nothing else - the chat
# service has no MCP_URL. The peer knows one URL (agent/agent.py: MCP_URL) and never the API's.
# ui-sa is on the MCP server and the peer because the operators mint as it for every smoke and for
# 7.3's and 8.4's notebooks (make smoke-mcp, make smoke-agent); chat-sa on the peer is 8.4's. The
# outsider is bound where a ROSTER answers - the API (run_eval.check_isolation, make eval-live), the
# chat service (make smoke-chat) and the MCP server (7.2's outsider call, make smoke-mcp): each
# verifies the token with shared/iap.identity and then refuses it by the roster, which is the
# refusal the gate is testing for. It is never bound on the peer, which has no roster to refuse it
# with. A person reaches the UI through IAP alone (lesson-12.4.sh binds IAP's service agent, and
# nothing else invokes it). The outsider is also bound on documind-gchat, the Google Chat bridge
# (workshop lesson 10.4, make smoke-gchat), whose code refuses every caller except Chat's add-on
# agent and Pub/Sub's push account (terraform/gchat.tf).
#
# The DocuMind Desk (workshop lesson 5.6) adds six callers to the chat service and to nothing
# else. The five documind-eval*-sa accounts are the people its live checks call as (make
# smoke-cases): each is put on one tenant's roster (make roster), so the chat service verifies the
# token and the roster answers, as it does for the outsider. documind-gchat-sa is the Google Chat
# bridge's account, named now so this line changes once, and bound once it exists (GCHAT_DOOR=true,
# terraform/gchat.tf); it is on no roster, so the chat service refuses it until the bridge exists,
# and nobody may mint as it (terraform/desk.tf, tools/check_authz.py).

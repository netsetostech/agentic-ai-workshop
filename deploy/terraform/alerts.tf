# Unanswerable rate spike (product signal, not infra)
# The alert reads two log-based metrics rag-api's query log feeds and alerts on their ratio.
#
# The first version extracted rag-api's 0/1 unanswerable_flag into ONE distribution metric
# and asked Monitoring for ALIGN_MEAN over it. Monitoring refused, on the first live apply
# (the first live run, 6 September 2026): a mean is defined for numeric series, not distributions,
# and an alert filter has to name a resource type. Two counters and a ratio is what the API
# allows, and it is also the honest shape - a rate is a numerator over a denominator.
#
# Before that, NOTHING created the metric the alert read, so terraform applied cleanly, the
# policy showed green in the console, and it could never fire. An alert that cannot fire is
# worse than no alert: it is a promise someone is relying on. The flag is still emitted (0/1
# beside the boolean) because a log filter matches on it directly.

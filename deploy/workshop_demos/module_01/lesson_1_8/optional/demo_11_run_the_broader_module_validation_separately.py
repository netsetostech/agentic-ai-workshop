"""Lesson 1.8: Run the broader module validation separately

The reindex smoke tests a different fixture and a wider lifecycle; it is not the proof of this chapter's deletion repair. make smoke-reindex uploads the kit's version 1 and version 2 under its own name, checks carry-over and reactivation, and asks the smoke-lantern question. Existing copies of that fact can affect the answer checks. Rehearse this separately, inspect its citations and fixture state, and report its actual pass/fail result. Do not replace the exact source and generation checks above with a green answer from this other note.

Run order inside this file:
1. Run the broader module validation separately (source window 39)

Prerequisites: demo_08_restore_the_exact_bytes_and_prove_reuse.
Use the existing rag-shell-venv interpreter; Run or Debug this file.
The functions below contain the lesson examples in source order. Helpers
supply configuration, authentication, state and CLI execution. See README.md
for expected observations, effects and the next file; GUIDE.md retains prose.
Example: open this file at the matching HTML heading, Run once, then inspect
the observations below before continuing to the next numbered section.
A successful process is not proof that a live result matched the sample.

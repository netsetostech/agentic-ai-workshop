"""Lesson 2.2: Before you run anything: set up the shell

DocuMind can answer a tenant's questions from four stores: its own Vector Search index (the ANN tier), the Firestore rung beneath it, or two managed mirrors, Vertex AI RAG Engine and Vertex AI Search. make up pins acme to RAG Engine and zeta to Vertex AI Search so every store the course teaches is exercised. A managed store holds the text of every current version, but not the kit's addresses: its citations come back with ids like acme:acme_497809ff...#rag-532341da71fe, a page of null even for a PDF, and stages.retrieval_backend: rag_engine. This lesson is about the kit's own rows, so point acme at them for the duration and put the pin back at the end. Module 2 compares the four stores; Module 7 studies the mirrors. Calls from the shell impersonate documind-ui-sa, the UI's own account, which make roster put on the three golden tenants (acme, zeta, globex). That is why a shell call can name any of the three. otok mints a token for documind-outsider-sa, an account IAM admits into the service and no roster lists. Tokens last about an hour; the functions mint a fresh one on every call. Your browser session is different: IAP signs you in as yourself, and the roster maps your email to exactly one tenant. Keep the two apart in your head; step 3 makes the difference visible. The index endpoint, the deployed index and the retrieval settings live in the API's environment; steps 3, 4 and 7 use them. An empty value means the setting's default, which the page names where it matters; a name the service does not set is unset rather than exported empty, because the kit's settings class reads an empty variable as a value, and step 8's cell imports the kit. The ablation's sparse leg needs rank_bm25, which the kit's images do not carry because no service runs it; the pip line puts it in the venv once.

Run order inside this file:
1. Which store answers acme? Pin it to the kit's own index for this lesson (source window 3)
2. Which store answers acme? Pin it to the kit's own index for this lesson (source window 6)

Prerequisites: workshop setup; see this lesson README.
Use the existing rag-shell-venv interpreter; Run or Debug this file.
The functions below contain the lesson examples in source order. Helpers
supply configuration, authentication, state and CLI execution. See README.md
for expected observations, effects and the next file; GUIDE.md retains prose.
Example: open this file at the matching HTML heading, Run once, then inspect
the observations below before continuing to the next numbered section.
A successful process is not proof that a live result matched the sample.

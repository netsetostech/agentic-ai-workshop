"""Lesson 6.2: The answer cache: a candidate that remembers answers

Do it

Run order inside this file:
1. Do it (source window 23)

Prerequisites: demo_04_the_rows_what_the_context_cache_did_to_the_bill.
Use the existing rag-shell-venv interpreter; Run or Debug this file.
The functions below contain the lesson examples in source order. Helpers
supply configuration, authentication, state and CLI execution. See README.md
for expected observations, effects and the next file; GUIDE.md retains prose.
Example: open this file at the matching HTML heading, Run once, then inspect
the observations below before continuing to the next numbered section.
A successful process is not proof that a live result matched the sample.

"""One tenant roster, read one way. Lesson 12.8.

The roster is Firestore, at `tenants/{tenant_id}/members/{email}`. Three surfaces need it and
each had arrived at its own version:

    rag-api/auth.py       is_member(email, tenant) - a POINT lookup. It is given the tenant and
                          asks "is this person in it?". Right for a service that receives a
                          tenant_id on the request and must authorise it.
    frontend/auth.py      tenant_for(email) - a REVERSE lookup by collection group. It is given
                          a person and asks "which tenant?". Right for a browser surface where
                          nobody sends a tenant at all.
    chat/agent.py         neither. It believed the request body.

Both directions are legitimate and both are here, so the next surface picks one instead of
writing a third. The member document is keyed by EMAIL so the point lookup is a single read,
and carries `email` as a FIELD so the reverse lookup is one collection-group query rather than
a scan of every tenant - that shape is load-bearing for both functions and is why neither is
implemented in terms of the other.

WHY A PERSON HAS ONE TENANT HERE. The reverse lookup returns the first match. DocuMind's model
is that a person belongs to one customer; a consultant working for two would need this to
return a list and every caller to choose, which is a product decision, not a code change. Said
out loud because "it returns the first row" is otherwise indistinguishable from a bug.

THE DATA-REGION POLICY (13 September 2026, evening). The roster says who may read a tenant's documents;
`tenant_settings/{tenant}.data_region` says where the platform may HOLD them - `in` (the kit's own rows in
asia-south1 and nothing else) or `any` (a managed store outside India may keep a copy: RAG Engine in
us-central1, Vertex AI Search in global - services/ingest/managed.py mirrors current versions there, and
rag-api reads them as a retrieval backend). Absent means `in`: fail closed. It is read here by the two
services (policy_for, permits) and written only by the operator (set_policy, `make tenant-policy`), for
the same reason membership is: a service that could widen its own tenant's region would be a service that
could enrol itself. Residency stopped being a deployment variable that day (managed-retrieval-plan
2026-09-13.md, section 7) and became this document, one field per tenant.

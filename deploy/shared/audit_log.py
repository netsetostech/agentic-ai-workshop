Named audit_log rather than audit so it cannot shadow anything, and the bucket handle is
LAZY: services/admin/audit.py resolves os.environ["AUDIT_BUCKET"] at import time, which
turns a missing env var into an ImportError at container start rather than a clear failure
at the first write. The ingest worker must not inherit that.

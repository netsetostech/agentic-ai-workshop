"""DocuMind agent tools - ONE implementation, consumed by every brain.

Module 8 ships three agent runtimes (ADK, LangGraph, and the direct RAG path) and Modules 6 and 7
ship two more surfaces (a LangChain loop and an MCP server). All of them answer questions about the
same documents. If each owns its own retrieval, they drift - and this course has already watched
that happen four times to a single cost function, which arrived in Module 6 with three different
shapes and in Module 7 and 8 with two more.

So retrieval lives here, once. A brain may decide WHEN to retrieve and WHAT to do with the result.
It does not get to decide what retrieval means.

The rule: no second implementation of `retrieve` should exist in the repo. Grep before a release
(`python tools/check_one_retrieval.py deploy/` does it properly).

TWO LANES, ONE FUNCTION (gap G3, 2026-09-05). `DOCUMIND_PROFILE=gcp` reaches rag-api over the
network; `DOCUMIND_PROFILE=local` reads the Chroma directory `shared/profile.py` opens, with no
cloud credential. The private helper below is not a second implementation - it is what the
one implementation does when the switch is set, and the contract out is identical.

TWO CREDENTIALS, ONE REQUEST (gap G4, 2026-09-05). Until today this file minted the ID token
correctly (lesson 7.3) and then sent two headers nothing verified - x-user-email and
x-tenant-id - under a comment claiming rag-api read them. A header anyone can set is a claim,
not a credential. The assertion of the PERSON the call is for is forwarded instead, when
there is one; otherwise the token's own identity is the caller (shared/iap.py, both legs).

Verified 2026-09-04 against deploy/services/rag-api/schemas.py.

"""One switch, two lanes. Lesson 6.4, step 7 - the file its notebook cell became.

    DOCUMIND_PROFILE=gcp     Gemini on Vertex AI + the shared index       (what production runs)
    DOCUMIND_PROFILE=local   Ollama gemma3:4b + a Chroma directory        (what you develop against)

The point is NOT that a local model is as good. It is not. The point is that a broken tool loop,
a bad prompt or a wrong schema can be found on a train with no signal, and that a new engineer
can run the thing on their first morning without a billing account - and, since 2026-09-05
(gap G3), that the DEPLOYED chat service runs on the same switch: `make chat-local` starts it
against this file's local lane with no cloud credential, which is also 13.2's Rs 0 lane.

The contract that makes this worth having: the agent code that calls these two builders is
identical in both lanes. The day a profile needs its own agent code, the switch has failed and
you are maintaining two applications under one name.

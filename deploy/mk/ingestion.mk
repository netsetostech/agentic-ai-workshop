# ---------- Ingestion (the v5 course's Module 1): the roster and the tenant pins, the vector tier, the ingest drills ----------
# Included by the Makefile (`include mk/*.mk`); every variable it uses is declared there. The drills that upload
# and wait are scripts under commands/ (the same operation without make); the roster is commands/lane.py roster.

# The roster is the tenancy boundary the surfaces enforce (shared/tenancy.py): a verified
# person on no roster is a 403. Needs google-cloud-firestore locally
# (pip install -r services/rag-api/requirements.txt once).

# Where ONE tenant's text may be held: tenant_settings/{TENANT}.data_region (shared/tenancy.py). `in` keeps it on
# the kit's rows (asia-south1); `any` lets the managed mirror copy its current versions into RAG Engine (us-central1)
# and Vertex AI Search (global) and the API read them (RETRIEVAL_BACKEND, or the tenant's own retrieval_backend
# pin). No service can write this field; without DATA_REGION the target prints the tenant's current policy.

# Held against the tenant's data_region on every request (rag-api main.py: an `in` tenant pinned to a managed

# `make up` returns with the index created and EMPTY - correct, vector.tf names no batch input and

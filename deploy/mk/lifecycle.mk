# Included by the Makefile (`include mk/*.mk`). reindex is commands/reindex.sh; the rest call the kit's own
# Python (services/ingest/reconcile.py, batch.py) and run the same way without make: commands/lane.py.

# reindex re-issues ONE document under an object name (NAME= overrides the basename: the shape-A demo re-uploads
# evals/demo/hr_policy_2026_v2.md AS hr_policy_2026.md) and waits for the worker's line - ingest_ok with the
# retired count, or ingest_reactivated when the bytes are a version the ledger had retired (the undo).

# expire_at and the ledger row says WITHDRAWN (12 September 2026) - a tombstone, not `retired`. The object stays in
# the bucket, the nightly reconcile leaves it there ("withdrawn, object kept"), the same bytes again are acked
# (ingest_withdrawn) and never reactivated, the corpus fingerprint moves so the caches follow. Before this the row
# said retired, and the next night's walk read "retired but back in the bucket" and resurrected what a person had

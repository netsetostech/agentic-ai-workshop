# ---- DEPLOY ----
# --ingress=all, and the boundary is identity, not the network: no unauthenticated calls, a
# bearer token from the UI's service account on every request (IAM invoker), and the person's
# own IAP assertion forwarded inside it (shared/iap.py). With internal-and-cloud-load-balancing
# the UI's call - which leaves through the public run.app hostname - and the eval gate's, from
# a GitHub runner, were both refused before any token was read.
#
# The env delimiter is ^|^ because the values carry ':' (every URL) and ',' (two audiences).
# RETRIEVAL_BACKEND=vector is the deployment's default (a tenant's pin can send it to the Firestore rung
# or a managed store); the two VECTOR_ variables come from `terraform output`; SELF_URL is the deterministic run.app URL.
# DEMO_MODE=1 (Module 9): /v1/media/generate serves a cached image for a prompt it has drawn before,
# so a demo re-running one prompt is one bill; DEMO_MODE=0 make deploy-services turns it off. The two
# bucket names are storage.tf's: generated assets in media, 9.4's signed PUTs into uploads.
# AUDIT_BUCKET: the media route writes the audit row through shared/audit_log.py, which refuses to drop an
# event without a bucket - and refuses BEFORE the spend since the first live generate went 500 after it.
# Module 10: the model is a SETTING. GENERATOR_MODEL is a name (global) or a tuned endpoint path (regional,
# generator.py picks the client); RAG_MODEL_BASE prices an endpoint at its base; ROUTING=on puts router.py and
# the budget breaker on the request path; BUDGET_USD is the month's cap; SPEND_PCT overrides the reading.
# 12.5's ledger (11 September 2026): RETRIEVAL_CURRENT_ONLY=on retrieves only chunks the ledger marks current -
# after the second vector index is built and make backfill-current has run; a candidate first, like every switch.
# 12 September 2026 (deploy/INDEXING.md): EMBEDDING_MODEL / EMBEDDING_VERSION are the one declared embedding - the same
# pair the ingest worker stamps on every chunk row, so the query vector and the document vectors come from one model.
# Module 12 (12.6): THE GUARD IS A SWITCH. ARMOR=on screens the prompt before retrieval and the buffered answer after
# it against the Model Armor template (asia-south1, with the data it inspects); off on the lane, on for the candidate
# 12.6 judges - make candidate ARMOR=on.
# Module 11: THE BACKEND IS A SETTING. MODEL_BACKEND=vertex is google.genai; gateway sends the same prompt to 11.3's
# LiteLLM gateway (LITELLM_URL, the deterministic URL, behind IAM) where GENERATOR_MODEL names a route - documind-slm
# is 11.4's self-hosted model. The lane runs vertex; make candidate MODEL_BACKEND=gateway is the A/B.
# 13 September 2026: RETRIEVAL_GRAPH=off|on|auto is 4.6's graph on the lane (shared/documind_graph.py, built by make graph):
# on walks the tenant's graph for every question, auto only for a relational question with a seed entity, and the walk's
# chunks go in front of the dense pool. Off on the lane; make candidate RETRIEVAL_GRAPH=auto is where it is judged.
# GRAPH_BACKEND=firestore|spanner (16 September 2026) is WHERE that graph lives: Firestore beside the chunks, or
# spanner.tf's Spanner Graph, which seeds the walk by meaning (SPANNER_INSTANCE / SPANNER_DATABASE name it).
# P9.4 (13 September 2026): RETRIEVAL_BACKEND=rag_engine is 4.3's corpus as the retrieval stage - the mirror 12.5 keeps
# (MANAGED_MIRROR), queried by text, its contexts mapped to the kit's chunks through the ledger. The DEFAULT store: a
# tenant's own retrieval_backend pin and its data_region (tenant_settings/{tenant}, make tenant-policy) decide per request
# (the corpora are us-central1-only), so the deploy hands the API the residency and RAG_LOCATION. A candidate first:
# make candidate RETRIEVAL_BACKEND=rag_engine, after make ablate ABLATE_ARGS="--arms all" has measured it.

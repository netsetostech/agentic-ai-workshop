"""DocuMind chat service - the surface, the identity, the memory, and the brain switch.

This is the production half of lesson 6.4, grown by 8.5 (a checkpointer), 8.7 (three brains
over one tool) and 12.8 (one identity). The brains live in `brains.py`; this file decides who
is asking, which tenant they are, which conversation this is, and which brain answers - then
logs one row saying so.

Six things here are load-bearing and easy to get wrong:

0. THE TENANT IS NOT A REQUEST FIELD. It used to be, and that made every document in every
   tenant readable with one curl. It is now looked up from the Firestore roster using the
   email on the verified IAP assertion. The retriever's tenant filter was always correct;
   it was filtering on a value the caller chose.

1. `wrap_tool_call` must return a `ToolMessage` or a `Command`, never a bare dict (brains.py).
2. `tenant_id` reaches the tools through the `ToolRuntime` the framework injects - its
   `.context` is the dict passed to `invoke(..., context=...)` - so it never appears in the
   schema the model reads. If it were an ordinary parameter the model would choose the tenant,
   which is a cross-tenant read wearing the costume of a tool argument. It was first written
   as `Annotated[str, InjectedToolArg]`, which hides an argument from the model and does
   nothing else: ToolNode never fills it, the tool ran with tenant_id="" and rag-api answered
   403 (proven offline 2026-09-05, gap G4). The person's IAP assertion travels the same way:
   read off this request, put in the context, forwarded to rag-api by the one `retrieve()`
   beside the service's own ID token - never sent as a header anyone could set.
3. THE PROFILE SWITCH IS 6.4's, UNCHANGED (gap G3). `shared/profile.py` decides the model
   (Gemini on Vertex AI, or Ollama gemma3:4b) and `documind_tools.retrieve()` decides the store
   (rag-api, or a Chroma directory). With DOCUMIND_PROFILE=local there is no IAP in front of
   this service either, so identity comes from LOCAL_USER / LOCAL_TENANT - a dev-only bypass
   that is explicit, named, and impossible to reach with the profile set to gcp.
4. A CONVERSATION SURVIVES A RESTART (gap G5, lesson 8.5). Every brain gets the checkpointer
   the profile chooses: SqliteSaver on the laptop, PostgresSaver on Cloud SQL in production,
   InMemorySaver only when CHECKPOINT_DSN=memory says so out loud. The thread id is
   `tenant:user:session` - 8.5's boundary - built by the SERVER from the verified identity, so
   a session id from the request can name a conversation but never a tenant. The connection
   is opened once, in the lifespan, and outlives every request: 8.5's trap is returning from
   inside `from_conn_string()`. `setup()` is NOT called here - `migrate.py` is a one-off job.
5. THE BRAIN IS A SWITCH, NOT A FORK (gap G6, lesson 8.7). DOCUMIND_BRAIN picks the default;
   `brain` on the request (allow-listed) overrides it per turn - that is the UI's radio. Brains
   are built lazily and cached for the process; one that is not installed is a 501, not a
   crash at startup. The usage row names the brain, and rag-api's row does too.

Verified 2026-09-04 against langchain 1.4.0 / langchain-google-genai 4.4.0. The bearer leg (SELF_URL)
arrived with Module 8 on the lane, 2026-09-08: it is what lets the chat service be called as a backend
and be smoke-tested from a shell, and it changes nothing for a person behind IAP.

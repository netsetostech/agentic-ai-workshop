"""DocuMind chat service - three brains over one tool. Lessons 8.1-8.7, gap G6.

8.7's harness put one question through three agent runtimes and printed three cost lines, and
the finding was that every difference was the HARNESS - the tool was identical. This module is
that harness, shipped: the same `tools.py` (which adapts the one `documind_tools.retrieve()`),
the same checkpointer, the same thread id, four ways to drive a model at them:

    langchain   6.4's create_agent + the guard as middleware          (the default)
    langgraph   8.5/8.6's hand-built StateGraph - agent, tools, refuse (more control, nothing done for you)
    adk         8.1-8.4's LlmAgent + Runner, the guard as before_tool_callback
    direct      no loop at all: one retrieve(), rag-api's own grounded answer - the floor to compare against

Which one answers is DOCUMIND_BRAIN (the deploy) or the `brain` field on the request (the UI's
radio, 12.4), allow-listed to these four names. `agent.py` dispatches and logs the brain on
every usage row; `documind_tools.retrieve(brain=)` carries it to rag-api so ITS row has it too.

Two honest limits. The ADK brain keeps its session in ADK's own session service, not the
LangGraph checkpointer - 8.3's Agent Engine sessions are its production answer; here it uses
DatabaseSessionService on the same Cloud SQL when CHECKPOINT_DSN is set, InMemorySessionService
otherwise. And each brain imports its framework lazily, so a deployment that does not install
google-adk simply reports that brain as unavailable (501), rather than failing to start.

Verified offline by commands/tests/test_chat_brains.py (workshop lessons 5.1, 5.4, 5.5 and 5.7): each turn's
own tool calls, refusals and numbered citations from all three agent brains, one tool declaration,
and one error contract. The ADK brain follows 8.7 cell 12 (google-adk 2.8.0). Each turn's limits -
model calls, rupees, time - are limits.py's, checked at each brain's own seam, and verified by
commands/tests/test_chat_limits.py (workshop lessons 5.5 and 5.7).

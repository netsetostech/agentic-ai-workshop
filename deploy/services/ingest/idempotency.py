# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ the ledger (11 September 2026)
# A document has an IDENTITY - its object path - and VERSIONS - the content hashes. `documents/{doc_key}` above is
# the per-version claim; `sources/{source_id}` is the per-document ledger: which version is current, its generation,
# when it was indexed, the date it declares. It is what every production indexer keeps (a record manager keyed on the
# source), and it is what lets a re-issued document RETIRE its predecessor's chunks instead of standing beside them.
# Retiring is a flag, never a delete: the audit story survives, the ANN tier's and the managed stores' mirrors keep their history, and a
# bad re-index is undone by uploading the previous bytes again (reactivate) - nothing is re-embedded.
#
# 12 September 2026 (deploy/INDEXING.md): the guard, the swap, the retention and the fingerprint. An event older than
# the ledger's generation is ignored (stale_generation). A new version lands STAGED and invisible, and one pass flips
# it current and retires the old (swap_versions) - a reader never sees two versions of one source. A retired row is
# stamped expire_at; the Firestore TTL policy in firestore_indexes.tf is the only thing that ever deletes a chunk,
# and nothing here calls delete. Every change refreshes the tenant's corpus fingerprint (ledger/{tenant}); the API's
# cache record carries the fingerprint it was packed from and stops being used when they differ.
#
# The tombstone and the verified undo (12 September 2026, the R05 findings). A source a person retires by hand
# (make retire) is `withdrawn` in sources/ - distinct from `retired` (its object left the bucket) and from `superseded`
# (a re-issue) - and nothing automatic brings it back: reconcile leaves the object where it is, the same bytes again
# are acked, reactivate() refuses; make restore SOURCE= clears it. And reactivate() counts before it flips: the rows
# still here against the claim's chunk count, the retire stamp (retired_at on documents/{doc_key}) against
# RETENTION_DAYS. A shortfall or a closed window is reactivate_incomplete, and the worker re-ingests the bytes instead
# of retiring the newer version over a partial undo.

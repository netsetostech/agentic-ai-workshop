The worker handles the incremental case on every object.finalized. This is the other half every production
indexer has (LangChain's `full` cleanup, Vertex AI Search's FULL reconciliation, Bedrock's sync): objects gone
from the bucket are RETIRED (flagged, not deleted, stamped expire_at), objects whose current generation is newer
than the ledger's are re-ingested by rewriting them onto themselves - a new generation fires the same finalize
event the worker already handles, so there is one ingestion path, not two - and objects the ledger never saw are
either backfilled from documents/ (same bytes, already indexed) or ingested the same way. Deletions need no
trigger. The walk ends with one number, drift: how far the ledger stood from the bucket when it started
(alerts.tf makes it a metric; the policy pages when it stays above zero for two nights). `make reconcile` runs
it from a shell; reconcile.tf declares the Cloud Run job on the ingest image and schedules it nightly beside
documind-off. The TTL policy in firestore_indexes.tf is the only deleter on the lane; --purge exists for a lane
that has not applied it, prints by default, and says so.

Two states the walk leaves alone (12 September 2026). A source a person retired by hand (--retire, make retire)
is `withdrawn`: its object is kept, and the first version of this planner read "retired in the ledger but back in
the bucket" and re-ingested it the same night - the worker's undo brought back what a person had just taken
down. Now the plan says "withdrawn, object kept" and does nothing; --restore (make restore) clears the tombstone
and rewrites the object so the worker's own path brings it back. And a document the worker handed to the batch
lane (`queued` on documents/, the batch job's to take) is reported as queued, not hashed and not rewritten every night.
Neither counts as drift.
